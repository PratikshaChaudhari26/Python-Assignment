 #Write a program which contains one class named as BankAccount.BankAccount class contains two instance variables as Name & Amount.
#That class contains one class variable as ROI which is initialise to 10.5.#Inside init method initialise all name and amount variables 
#by accepting the values from user.There are Four instance methods inside class as Display(), Deposit(), Withdraw(), CalculateIntrest(). 
#Deposit() method will accept the amount from user and add that value in class instance variableAmount. 
#Withdraw() method will accept amount to be withdrawn from user and subtract that amount from class instance variable Amount.
# CalculateIntrest() method calculate the interest based on Amount by considering rate of interest which is Class variable as ROI. 
#And Display() method will display value of all the instance variables as Name and Amount.
#After designing the above class call all instance methods by creating multiple objects.
